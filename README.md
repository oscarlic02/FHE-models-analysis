## Overview

The **FHE-models-analysis** project is dedicated to the exploration and evaluation of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) models. FHE allows computations on encrypted data, preserving privacy and security throughout the process.

This repository includes research and findings documented in `research.ipynb`, which provides detailed insights into the performance and applicability of FHE models in various scenarios.

## Features

- **In-depth Analysis**: Comprehensive evaluation of FHE models using real-world datasets.
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed benchmarking of speed, accuracy, and computational efficiency.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of results for better understanding.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/FHE-models-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd FHE-models-analysis
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
