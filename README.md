## Overview

The **FHE-models-analysis** project focuses on analyzing and evaluating Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) models. FHE enables computations on encrypted data without decrypting it, ensuring data privacy and security.

## Features

- **Model Evaluation**: Analyze the performance of various FHE models.
- **Benchmarking**: Compare FHE models based on speed, accuracy, and resource usage.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/FHE-models-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd FHE-models-analysis
    ```
3. Follow the setup instructions in the `INSTALL.md` file.
